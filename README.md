Email Classification using Logistic Regression

Email Classification System

Description :
The Email Classification System is a machine learning-based project designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). This system leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), to convert raw email text into numerical features that can be processed by machine learning models. The model used for classification is Logistic Regression, a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks.

The dataset used in this project is the SpamAssassin Public Dataset, which contains a collection of email messages labeled as either spam or ham. The system is trained on this dataset and can predict whether a new email or message is spam or not.

The project demonstrates the complete pipeline of data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.It also demonstrates how machine learning and NLP techniques can be used to build a robust and scalable email classification system.
